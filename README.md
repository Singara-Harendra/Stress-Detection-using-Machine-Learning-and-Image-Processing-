🧠 Stress Detection using Machine Learning & Image Processing

This project aims to detect human stress levels using a combination of machine learning and image processing techniques. By analyzing facial features and expressions from real-time or static images, the system classifies the stress level of an individual, offering a non-invasive, automated approach to stress detection.


🔍 Key Features

Facial Image Processing: Detects and extracts key facial landmarks from input images or live webcam feed.
Emotion Analysis: Utilizes facial emotion recognition to interpret stress-indicative expressions.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on labeled datasets to classify stress as stressed or not stressed.
Real-Time Detection: Optionally supports real-time stress detection via webcam.


🛠 Technologies Used

Python
OpenCV
scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (based on your model)
dlib / mediapipe / face_recognition (for facial landmarks)
NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

📌 Applications

Mental health monitoring systems
Workplace stress assessment
Human-computer interaction
Educational and clinical research
